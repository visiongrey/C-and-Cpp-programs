# C-and-Cpp-programs
These are some common C/C++ programs.
Note : 1. The file "inv.c" asks for name of item,it's price and no. and puts it at the end of file "items". The previous items are 
printed present in "items". 
2. The two files "client.c" and "server.c" are to be run together. The client asks for a name of a file and 'server' searches for it. 
If found, it transfers the contents in encrypted format. The client decrypts it.
